        <h2>Best Time to Visit Kaparkan Falls</h2>
  
      <p>Abra’s falls come alive during the rainy season which is sometime from August to September.<br>The rest of the year it stays dry leaving the limestone terraces empty.
      <br> Even if you want to visit during the dry season, you won’t be able to because the area is closed off.
    <br> <br>Before going to Abra, make sure to plan your visit in advance with the local tourism office or a tour group. <br>All travelers need to secure slots before they’re permitted to visit. <br>This process was put in place to prevent overcrowding and to help maintain the beauty of Kaparkan Falls.</p>

    <h2>From Baguio to Abra</h2>
    <p>There are direct trips by Partas bus from Baguio to Bangued, Abra. It usually takes 5 hours of land travel. 
      <br>A bus ticket shouldn’t cost you more than 400 PHP.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>From Vigan to Abra</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, there is no direct bus for this route. From Vigan, ride a bus going to Narvacan, Ilocos Sur.
      <br> Alight at the highway intersection to Abra. Wait for a bus bound for Bangued, Abra. <br>
      Although Vigan is less than 2 hours away from Abra, your commute might be longer due to the wait.
    </p>
    
    
    <h2>Bangued to Tineg</h2>
    <p>Once in Bangued, make your way to Fariñas Ilocos Empanada along Abra-Kalinga road. <br>
      Registration and orientation will be held there. Travelers will board either a military truck or jeepney to get to Kaparkan Falls.
    <br><br> Brace yourself for a 3-hour ride from Bangued to Tineg.<br>
    The first hour will be smooth traveling on paved roads but the rest of the way it’ll be a bumpy ride. 
  <br>According to Google reviews, it’s like “a roller coaster by land”. This is no exaggeration: the vehicle’s wheels need chains to get across the rough terrain 
  <br>(as pictured above)! For those who want to skip the ride, travelers can trek to the falls instead for a total of 8 hours.
  <br>Upon arriving at the jump-off, it’s a short 20-30 minute trek down to Kaparkan Falls.</p>
  
  
  <h2>What to Expect at Kaparkan Falls</h2>
  <p>As mentioned, Kaparkan Falls is regulated by the local government. The max carrying capacity of the falls is 100 people at a time so visitors are only allowed in batches<br>
  Three hours are allotted per batch so maximize your stay at this natural wonder! Keep in mind that you might have to wait for your turn if a group arrives before you.
  <br>You can further climb down the pools to explore the area more. The limestone steps are not slippery despite being wet but exercise caution anyway. <br>
  Please be advised that there is no restroom in the area.</p>
