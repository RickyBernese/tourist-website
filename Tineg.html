    <h2>1.KAPARKAN FALLS</h2>
       <p>This is perhaps one of the most famous tourist attractions in Abra. Unlike most popular falls in the country, Tineg is bizarrely unique. 
           It cascades in a terraced-like manner on bare limestone rocks.
             According to the locals, the waters do not turn murky even during the rainy months. 
               That is because they emanate from an underground spring. Collectively, the falls measures around 500 meters high and 60 meters wide.  
               The surrounding forests also add beauty to the sight. No wonder, some locals tag the place as “Mulawin.” 
                By the way, Kaparnakan falls feeds the Tineg River.</p>
