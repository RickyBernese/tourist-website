        <li><b>Dolores as we know it today was a settlement formerly called Bucao. The place was named after the chieftain of the first settlers who were Itnegs.
             Bucao was already an organized settlement as early as the first part of the 17th century. <br>
              Its first recorded history was in the year 1615 when Fr. Juan Pareja established a small bamboo church and a convent in the area. 
              The parish of Tayum supervised the mission since the town of Tayum has then the political jurisdiction over the place. <br>
               Years later, a group of dark-complexioned people settled in the area now called Isit, a derivation from the Ilocano word Nangisit, which means black. 
               And as migration took place, different groups of Ilocano settlers from Ilocos Sur, Bangued and Tayum established their homes in the villages in and adjacent to Bucao.</b></li>
        <li><b>In 1884, Rosalio Eduarte, the son of Ignacio, became the gobernadorcillo. 
                A year later, in 1885, Bucao was renamed Dolores in honor of the wife of the Spanish Governor  who incidentally also donated an image of the Nuestra Señora delos Dolores which the town was dedicated to.</b></li>

    <h2>1. Libtec Crystal Cave </h2>
         <p> this is one of the famous tourist spots in Abra. It is also called Quiling Crystal Cave. 
             <br> to the locals, the cave was already popular among hunters and trappers from a nearby community.<br>
                    The cave hosts numerous bats locally known as kurarapnit. Unfortunately, their population dwindled due to overhunting.
                   <br>Inside the cave, you’ll find wonderfully-formed stalagmites, stalactites, straws, drapery, and flowstones. 
                      <br>These formations portray the shape of a horse, a bird, a banana blossom, and many more.
             <br> blossom, and many more.
                       Unlike in other caves, spelunking here is relatively easy. You don’t need to wade on water, rappel, or crawl into narrow openings.
