            <h1>History and Government</h1>
            <p>The first people of Luba were Tingguians belonging to the Maeng Tribe, considered the biggest tribe in the Cordillera. 
                The places with the municipality of Luba where the early people settled were Tayab, Caonoan, Pasungan, Sasabtan and Cappini. 
                As the number of people increased, the settlers spread to nearby places. Those who first occupied Caonoan moved to Lao-ingen, Nagbukel and Topika. The settler of pasungan moved to Gayaman while the early settlers of Sasabtan and Cappini occupied Luzong and Barit.
                 Other places where also occupied by the early settlers such as Sabnangan, Bangcagan and later on in Pacpaca, Tabangao, Banoa-ao, Pega and Agumanay. <br>Luba was first called Barit-Amtuagan, because Amtuagan was then a part of the place. 
                 Later, the name was changed Barit-Lulluna because another district, Tiempo, claimed Amtuagan to be its part. From the first who letters of the words Barit and Lulluno, Balu become the name of the place. </p>
