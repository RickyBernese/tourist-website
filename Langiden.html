    <h4>History and government</h4>
    <p><li>The word Langiden originated from an Ilocano term “langi” meaning the outgrowth of a plant as in the development of a bamboo shoot. Langiden was considered a shoot which grew from an old small village to a new town. To add beauty and color, the word “den” was added to the word “langi” forming the word langiden.
        <br>
        Langiden is one of the oldest inhabited localities of Abra. Its natives originated from the second wave of malay immigrants who came to the philippines and and landed on the shores of Northern Luzon specially Ilocos Sur where the Abra River emptied its overflow.
          With the coming of the Spaniards, many Malay immigrants resited their conversion to Christianity. They were then driven upstream of the Abra River into the hinterlands of Abra by the Spaniards calling them Itnegs or Tinguians.
            Most of the Tinguians settled on the eastern bank of the Abra River at sitio Calawag now called Nagbabayan. Some of them however, went further upstream giving birth to other settlements with some settling on what is now Langiden. Some of the early settlements which grew as Barangays forming Langiden were: Baac, Dalayap, Quillat, Malapaao and Poblacion.

    <h2>10. Mt. Bullagao</h2>
    <p><li>Mt. Bullagao projects the shape of a woman lying prostrate on her back,
        <br> her breasts sharply contoured, and her reclined head facing the sky.
         <br> From Bangued, provincial town of Abra, the mountain looks like a woman giving birth. <br>
             That is why the Mt. Bullagao is popularly known as Abra’s Sleeping Beauty.
    <br> Near the summit, there is a small plateau, covered in grasses. There are also small patches of secondary forests.<br>
           From the top and along the trails near it, one can view the surrounding mountains and plains of Ilocos Sur, Abra, and the mighty Abra River.
